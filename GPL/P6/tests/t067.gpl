// You must issue the error for "a" being previously decleared before you 
// issue the error for rectangle not having an "xyz" field.
// The trick is to check for "a" in the symbol table right after you create
// the rectangle (you still have to create a rectangle, but it will not
// end up in the symbol table).
int a;
