# GPL Phase-1

### Due Date
Thursday, September 5, 2024, by the beginning of class.

### Title
Getting Familiar with GPL by Wirting Your Own Arcade Game in GPL.

### Description

The goal of this phase is for you to get familiar with the GPL language before you develop the interpreter for it.

Your game should be at least as complex as **pong.gpl**. This means that your game should at least have...
- two objects
- one animation block to animate the object(s)
- receive user input (e.g., an object moves when the user clicks arrow keys)

You can utilize any code from the provided samples, but simply copying & pasting the code won't help you much to proceed with the project.

**You will present your game to the class on Thursday.**

### Prerequisite

1. GPL binary that is suitable for your machine's architecture.
2. C/C++ compiler (GCC, G++, Clang, Clang++)
3. Bison
4. Flex
5. OpenGL

### How to Submit

1. Create _P1_ directory under _GPL_ directory in your repository.
2. Add all files, including the gpl file, to run your game to _P1_ directory.
3. Commit and push to your repository.
